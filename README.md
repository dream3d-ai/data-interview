# Take-Home Assignment: Video Processing Pipeline

## Overview

In this assignment, you will design and implement a highly-parallel video processing pipeline that operates on the `validation` split of the [Kinetics dataset](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/kinetics-dataset). The pipeline should perform the following steps:

1. **Download Videos:**  
   Efficiently download videos from a provided list of URLs using an HTTP client (e.g., `aiohttp`). For testing, you can limit the data to the first shard.

2. **Transcode Videos and store in Lance format:**  
   Aggregate metadata and video data and store it in a dataset in the [Lance format](https://lancedb.github.io/lance/index.html). You should transcode each downloaded video to 360p. Use your discretion on how to store the transcoded videos. Please explain your reasoning. The video data will be used in a pytorch dataloader which will decode the video on the fly.

3. **Important: Parallelism**  
   The dataset consists of many large shards, requiring an efficient parallel processing strategy. Consider the different levels of parallelismâ€”such to optimize each stage of the pipeline. You are free to choose any concurrency model, but ensure that the approach is scalable and fault-tolerant. [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/?_gl=1*azgm7f*_gcl_au*MTE5MjAyNjI3MC4xNzM5NTYxNjQ3) is an option for task distribution and resource management across multiple workers.

4. **Optional**: Depth Map Extraction:
Use a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to extract a depth map from each video frame, and store it as a column in the Lance dataset. Again, explain your reasoning for your choice of model and how the extracted depth maps will be stored.


## Setup Instructions

- Install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and ensure it is available in your system's `PATH`.
- Install [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
- Install the dependencies using UV `uv sync`.

## Additional Notes

- **Assumptions:** Clearly state any assumptions made, such as the format of the input URLs or the choice of resolution.
- **Enhancements (Optional):**
  - Consider implementing retries for failed downloads.
  - Although using Ray is required, you can explore additional optimizations in task distribution.
  - Write a brief summary of potential improvements if this were a production-level system.

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your implementation!
